# Named_Entities_Project

<h1>Introducation</h1>

we developed a bilingual Arabic-English lexicon of named entities (NE). The construction of this lexicon is based on three main resources: Semantic web standard DBpedia, Arabic-English parallel corpus and linguistic tools. Using these resources, aligned equivalent Named Entities are detected and extracted automatically from the Arabic-English corpus. To reach our goal, we followed different steps starting by the pre-editing of the linked data entities and the parallel corpus and then applying our automatic model for detection, extraction and translation of Arabic-English Named Entities. Our approach is fully automatic and hybrid, it combines linguistic and statistical methods. We obtained an Arabic-English lexicon of 65203 pairs of Named Entities.
